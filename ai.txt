about the product/app: an event and ticket management platform, clients see events and can buy tickets via stripe and event organisers can create events see sold tickets handle event details and managers or ticket scanners.

Important:
- atom components are located in src/_components/atoms/
- also using shadcn, shadcn atoms located in src/_components/shadcn/
- layouts components should be use dinstead of regular div with styling, good examples are <Stack /> instead of <div className="flex flex-col" /> etc.. these layout components are located in src/_components/layouts 
- Note: the Stack and Group and other layouts components work with tailwind and className="" 

Make use of the above when composing other components like molecules, organisms or pages. 
- Molecule components are just display components without state or super simple state (on/off). Molecules live in src/_components/molecules/.
  Example of a molecule is a Call to action section, which is made of mainly atoms - maybe a smaller molecule component too.
- Organism coponents can be made of both molecules and atoms, but what mainly sets them apart is state complexity and side-effects, like calling CRUD hooks or callbacks.
- Pages are the main Next.js app router pages

Furthermore:
- common utils can be found here: src/utils/common.ts
- any prisma ORM db calls should be added in src/server/queries and imported in the server component using them
- prefer using zustand for shared state management, place store failes in src/zustand/ 
- any custom hooks should go in src/_hooks
- the prisma schema is in ./prisma/schema.prisma and should always be considered when working on an organism or page or server action
- any third party API implementation goes in src/services/
- currently have s3, fal and stripe as third party API implementations

Don't forget:
- always consider dark / light mode as there's a theme
- theme colors can be found in ./tailwind.config.ts
- pay good attention on the primary/secondary/tertiary colors used in the theme when composing
- always prefer reusing existing atoms/shadcn rather than creating new ones

When responding with an answer think and ABSOLUTELY RETURN ONLY CODE, no bloat explanatory text - unless I asked explicitly for an explanation.







WHAT WE NEED TO BUILD:

- landing page for main SaaS
- auth, for main org owners
- sub system (free tier -> website is via our domain, paid tier -> u can use ur own website (just set X nameservers))
- dashbboard/account area for users to see their websites (1 for free tier, unlimited for paid)
- per website see statistics (page visits, sales etc..) and be able to manage (currently the /staf/manage page of each website is this -> could link to there?)
- account settings for org owner -> unsub etc..
- customizable main/secondary button colors


NICE 2 HAVES:
- seats per event mapping when booking (event seats type vs any spot)
- collaborators -> dasboard for each collaborator to track how many sales via their link
- layouts: different layouts of event cards & pages (not colors)
- simple shop page to allow websites to also sell stuff
- dashbaord for org owner/admin to track sales stuff + role for ecommerce manager
